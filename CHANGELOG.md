# RSS Dashboard - Changelog

## [2.2.17] - March 6, 2026

### Added

- Added an optional Media setting to detect YouTube shorts from feed XML.
- Automatically tag detected shorts as `Youtube short`, while preserving the regular `youtube` media tag.

### Improved

- Standardized YouTube embed generation through a shared media-service helper.
- Routed embedded playback through Privacy Enhanced Mode using `youtube-nocookie.com`.
- Added a visible `Watch on YouTube` handoff from the in-app player.
- Documented YouTube embed behavior and legal links in the README.
- Add/Edit Feed validation now distinguishes valid-but-empty feeds with a yellow warning message instead of a generic success state.
- Refreshed the Tags settings auto-tagging UI to use Obsidian-native `Setting` layouts, unified section surfaces, clearer rule/condition cards, and less disruptive in-place editing.

### Fixed

- Fixed YouTube embed Error 153 by setting iframe `referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`.
- Removed unsupported YouTube quality override URL rewriting from the player.
- Enforced a minimum 200x200 YouTube player surface to better match RMF requirements.
- Added regression tests for YouTube embed URL generation, feed video-id normalization, and YouTube shorts detection/tagging.
- Search feeds no longer closes immediately after opening a feed from the filtered list
- Valid feeds with no published items can now still be added manually instead of being rejected as unusable.
- Empty-feed validation/import messaging is now explicit, and the Add Feed modal no longer closes after a failed save attempt.
- Fixed card-view tag overflow by moving tags into a footer-adjacent single-row strip with `+N` compaction, while restoring normal auto-grid density and bounded preview media sizing.
